# Customer-Segmentation
1) Created Segments of customers using the K-means clustering algorithm using Scikit-Learn library in Machine Learning.
2) Analyze the dataset in different ways, and also Visualize the dataset to know the details of the dataset and find the relation between different columns using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python
3) Used Clustering algorithm efficiently to create clusters and segment the data.


## Library Used:

Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
